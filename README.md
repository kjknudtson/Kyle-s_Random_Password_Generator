# Kyle's Random Password Generator

## Description

In this project, I was assigneded the task of coding a Javascript function that would work with already provided HTML and CSS to provide a user with a randomly generated password using the parameters they provide.  The parameters are, in order: the password length (from 8 to 128 characters), lower case letters included, upper case letters included, numbers included, and symbols included.  Once all parameters are set the generated password appears instantly containing at least one of each character the user desires, as well as, being the length that was assigned.  This was an interesting assignment to do, as I got in-depth on learning how to use arrays and combining arrays and using logic to make sure that, regardless of what any user wants, they will get the password that fits what they requested.  

## Usage

When the window opens you will see a box in the center of the page with a red button at the bottom of it reading "Generate Password".  Clicking the buttom will cause a prompt to open up asking the user to input how long they would like their password to be.  Upon doing so, four more prompts will open, each asking the user whether they would like to have their password contain lower case, upper case, numbers, and/or symbols.  Once the user has answered the final prompt a randomly generated password will appear in the center of the box, fulfilling every desire the user has input.
